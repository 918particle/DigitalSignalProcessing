\small
Download the gaussian.m script from the Moodle code folder.  In the first graph, we see a Gaussian pulse added to noise.  The magnitude of the Fourier spectrum is plotted in the second.  In the third graph, the unwrapped phase in degrees is plotted versus frequency.  Notice that it depends on frequency (linearly, but part of the graph is logarithmic).  Using the \textbf{flipud} and the \textbf{fliplr} Octave functions, see if you can cancel the phase as we described in class.  This assignment is due Monday, Jan 28th, but you may submit it as soon as it is finished.
